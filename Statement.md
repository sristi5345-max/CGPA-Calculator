INTRODUCTION:
The Cgpa calculator is a python based program that allows a student toh keep a good track on their performance.By entering the credit and grade they can easily obtain the cgpa without much manual work.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1.Students need to calculate their cgpa based on their grades and credits for respective courses.
2.Doing this manually could be time taking and more likely to have error.
3.With the help of a simple python program one can easily calculate cgpa.

OBJECTIVE:
1.It's being designed so that students can keep a good track on their performance.
2.It saves our time by being quick yet efficient.
3.It reduces the error which is most like to occur if done manually.

SCOPE:
1.Takes the number of courses as input.
2.Further it takes grade and credits for each course.
3.Checks whether the input is valid or not.
4.Calculates the cgpa based on standard grade-point mapping.
5.Finally displays the CGPA rounded to two decimal places.

METHODOLOGY:
1.The cgpa calculator ask the user to enter the number of courses which further takes two inputs- grade and credit 
2.Further the program validates the inputs provided by the user.
3.Finally the program displays the cgpa according to the grade point map.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
1.The cgpa is displayed upto two decimal places.
2.The program throws an error if we provide invalid input,credit or grade.

LIMITATIONS:
1.It only includes A,B,C,D and F.
2.It does not store data,user needs to input the data and program displays the result accordingly.

IMPROVEMENTS:
1.Grades like A+,B+ to be included.
2.By using import/export, more data could be added.
3.Semester wise gpa and the overall cgpa calculation.
