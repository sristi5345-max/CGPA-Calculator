OVERVIEW
This CGPA Calculator is a simple Python based program that enables the  students to calculate Cumulative Grade Point Average. One can just enter their grades and the credits for each subject, and the program displays the result. It checks whether the inputs are valid, maps your grades to their corresponding points, and calculates your weighted CGPA.
Overall, it's a straightforward project that uses basic programming tools such as loops, conditions, dictionaries, user input handling, and error checking.

FEATURES:
Grade Input System: Enter grades (A, B, C, D, F) and the program automatically converts them into grade points.

Credit-Based Calculation: Uses subject credits to compute an accurate weighted CGPA.

Input Validation: Catches wrong grade entries, invalid numbers, or zero/negative credits.

Error Handling: Built with try-except blocks, so the program doesn’t crash on bad inputs.

Clear Output: Shows your final CGPA rounded to two decimal places.

Flexible Course Count: Works no matter how many subjects you enter.

TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPT USED:
Language: Python 3

Tools: Any Python editor or terminal (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

Core Concepts:
Loops (for)
Conditional logic (if-else)
Exception handling (try-except)
Dictionaries for grade mapping
Basic user input and output

HOW TO TEST THE PROGRAM:
1. Open any Python environment (IDLE, VS Code, terminal, etc.).
2. Copy the full code into a file—example: cgpa_calculator.py.
3. Run the file using:
python cgpa_calculator.py
or press F5 in your editor.
4. Enter how many courses you have.
Example:
How many courses? 3
5. For each course, enter the grade and corresponding credits.
Example:
Grade for course 1: A
Credits for course 1: 4
Grade for course 2: B
Credits for course 2: 3
Grade for course 3: C
Credits for course 3: 2
6. The program will display your calculated CGPA.
Example:
CGPA = 8.22
7. You can also try entering invalid grades or negative credits to see how the program handles errors.
